This is a generative AI application built using Langchain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. It uses firebase for database storage and other modules (present in the code). The application summarizes and lists important details from a lecture/meeting and outputs it in a paragraph format, as-well as an aesthetically-pleasing image format. 

Currently Notesmaxx has 2 methods of upload: Youtube and Manual Upload.
